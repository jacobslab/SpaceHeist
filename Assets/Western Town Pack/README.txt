Instructions
------------

Download this pack from the Unity Asset Store and import it into your project.

Open the scene "Demo Scene" located in the "Western Town Pack" base folder.

You can start right away to place ready made buildings in your scene, those are located in "Western Town Pack/Prefabs/Buildings"

Or you can assemble custom houses using building parts, all prefabs are located in "Western Town Pack/Prefabs/"
When assembling custom houses, use Unity's vertex snap ("v" key) to quickly snap walls and other models together.

Prefab such as walls, doorways and windows have been created with "Slots", visible in the hierarchy panel, for you to drop the fitting prefab directly into place.
Shutters fit into Windows, Doors fit into doorways, Windows and Doorways fit into Walls.

Single slot suffix for doors "_D", shutter "_S", window "W"
Double slots suffix for doors "_DD", shutter "_SS", window "WW"

Once you have placed a door or shutter, they can be assigned a default animation in the inspector to be played automatically. They also have animations for "open" and "close" that can be used by your script.

All prefabs have been setup with colliders.

Tumbleweed have been setup to roll in the wind and collide with the environment, they are affected by external forces such as Winzones.
